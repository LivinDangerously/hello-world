Hello World,

I am Sean.  I have become a obsessed with augmented reality.  I was learning web development (I will throw some of that incomplete work on this) but have now scrapped that to start learning Kotlin to hopefully work on AR games and apps in the future to make this world more exciting.  I also like hot sauce and sports and have never thought about moon tacos until now but want them more than Earth tacos.
